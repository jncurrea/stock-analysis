# Stock Analysis with VBA
## Overview of Project
### Purpose and Backcground
The purpose of this challenge was to refactor a VBA Macro whcih is incharge of analyzing stocks information for the years 2017 and 2018. The goal of this analysis was to help Steve and his parents to determine if certain Stocks were worth investing in or not.
## Results
### Analysis
Notice how in 2017, one had a lot more options of having a successful investment given the fact that the stocks rose a lot during this year.\

Now, notice how in 2018 there is a drastic change with all the tickers. The stocks dropped in a significant way during 2018.\

What this comparison shows us is how volatile are these stocks and how one cannot make an investment decision only focusing on two years. One has to go back on more years in order to identify trends and therefore, make a smart and succesful investment.\

## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages
I believe that there are mostly advantages when refactoring code. The first advantage that I see, is the fact that one can make code more readable for future opportunities. Also, a second advantage that I see is the fact that one can optimize code's running time when refactoring code as it is seen in the case of this challenge./
### Pros and cons applied to refactoring the original VBA script
As I mentioned before, one of the most important pros that I see is the fact that code is a lot more readable. Therefore, I attach the VBA code to show the fact that is easy to read and understand.\
